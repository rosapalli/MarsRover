stuff to consider:
- singleton pattern for factory 
- singleton pattern for plateau 
- how to input the instructions into the application? 
    write existing text file or upload new text file? 
- what code is needed to execute the application? 

should movement become an abstract class with different sub-classes for each cardinal point? 

abstract class Movement {
abstract function turnLeft()
abstract function turnRight()
abstract function moveForward()
}

class North extends Movement {
turnLeft()
turnRigth()
moveForward()

then create a factory that initiates the right type of movement implementation based on the attributes of the rover
