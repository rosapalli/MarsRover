stuff to consider:
- how to input the instructions into the application? 
- what code is needed to execute the application? 
- do I need to create an interface

should movement become an abstract class with different sub-classes for each cardinal point? 
e.g.
abstract class Movement {
abstract function turnLeft()
abstract function turnRight()
abstract function moveForward()
}

class North extends Movement {
turnLeft()
turnRigth()
moveForward()

 
TO DO:
- complete factory testing
- complete readFile testing
- review assumptions and identify any further tests needed
