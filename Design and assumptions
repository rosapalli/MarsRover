DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- OOP 
- TDD
- Simplicity

ARCHITECTURE
three main classes:
- plateau: has set dimensions and passes these as an array
- rover: has set position and passes these as a string
- movement: changes the coordinates and direction of the rover in relationship to the dimensions of the plateau
supported by:
- factory: instantiates any of the classes as required

ASSUMPTIONS
- the plateau has set dimensions
- there can only be one plateau 
- more than one rover can be on the same coordinates at the same time
- several movement instructions can be processed in one go
- the rover's movement is limited within the plateau 
- the plateau maximum x- and y- coordinates have to be larger than 0
- movement instructions can be different lengths 
- movement instructions will never contain an integer
- rover coordinates are always two integers and one letter
- plateau settings are always two integers
- the input is always passed in the correct format 
- the x and y coordinates can never be less than 0
